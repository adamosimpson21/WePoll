# WePoll Readme

Welcome to my App! 

This App is a personal project by me, BandsWithLegends. I'm hoping to improve my skills as a developer in a real world environment.

The app is designed as a way for people to voice their opinions by answering questions about real world issues. A user will be able to log in, search out what questions they would like to answer by title,
then learn about their question through some educational research link. Afterwards, they can choose from a multiple choice answer to the question, then see how others voted compared to them.
Parties, Items, and Settings are in Alpha stages of development.
